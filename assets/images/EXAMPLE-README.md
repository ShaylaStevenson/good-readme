This is a README file created using my readme generator, Good README. It is a command line application that walks the developer through a series of prompts, and then writes the input as markdown to a new file.

  ## Installation
  To install Good README, you must first 'git clone' the repo's URL, git@github.com:ShaylaStevenson/good-readme.git. Next you will need to install the required packages by typing 'npm i' into the command line.


  ## Usage
  To use the application, open your terminal to the main directory of the good-readme file. Next, type 'node index.js'. You will then be greeted with a series of prompts to answer with details about your project. Once the prompts have completed, you will find your newly created readme file in the main directory.
